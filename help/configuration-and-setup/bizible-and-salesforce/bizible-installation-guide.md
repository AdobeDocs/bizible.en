# Bizible Installation Guide {#bizible-installation-guide}

In this guide we will be walking you through how to install and set up Bizible. For implementation we will need admin level access to the following:

* Salesforce
* Integrated Ad Platforms - AdWords, Bing Ads, and Facebook
* Website

## Salesforce Packages to Install {#salesforce-packages-to-install}

We will be installing two packages within your Salesforce environment and then completing additional configuration for full visibility into Bizible.  
  
[Bizible.com/sf](https://bizible.com/sf): This is our base package which includes our custom objects and fields. We recommend installing within Production for all users.  
  
[Bizible.com/dashboard-mt](https://bizible.com/dashboard-mt): This is our Dashboard Extension Package, which contains 3 pre-built dashboards. We recommend installing within Production for all users.

## Salesforce Configuration {#salesforce-configuration}

[Page Layouts](/help/configuration-and-setup/bizible-and-salesforce/page-layout-instructions.md): This is not necessary, but making these page layout updates allows Bizible Touchpoints to be visible on an individual record.

[Bizible Permission Sets](/help/configuration-and-setup/bizible-and-salesforce/bizible-permission-sets.md): These are assigned to the users of the Bizible product based on the level of accessibility youâ€™d like the users to have.

[Sharing Reports and Dashboard Folders](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=analytics_share_folder.htm&type=0): Out of the box, the reports and dashboard folders we create are only visible to the install user. These will need to be shared with additional Bizible users.

[Hide Report Types](/help/configuration-and-setup/bizible-and-salesforce/hiding-unnecessary-report-types.md): Many of the Report Types we create within our product are not needed. To avoid confusion when learning to report on the product, we recommend hiding those that you don't need.

[Custom Amount Field Workflow](/help/advanced-bizible-features/custom-revenue-amount/using-a-custom-revenue-amount-field.md) (if necessary): If you are using a custom amount field to record revenue in Salesforce, we will need a workflow created to map this field value to our Bizible Opportunity Amount field for revenue attribution reporting. Please be sure to let your Success Manager know if you're using a custom amount.

## Set up Your Adobe Admin Console and Identity Provider {#set-up-your-adobe-admin-console-and-identity-provider}

The first step to using Bizible is to create and sign-in to your provisioned Adobe Admin Console. If you haven't already received the email with log-in instructions, please contact your Bizible Account Representative.

As a product within the Adobe Suite, Bizible leverages the full functionality of Adobe Admin Console for Identity Management.  More resources can be found here: https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html

We recommend reviewing all of the resources, best practices, and options available to you for Identity Management: https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/set-up-identity.html

For guidance and review of setting up your Identity Management within the Adobe Admin Console, please reach out to your Bizible Account Representative.

In order to facilitate user authentication and authorization with your Bizible instance(s), the following steps are required within the Adobe Admin Console to setup the appropriate User Groups.

**Setting up User Groups in the Adobe Admin Console**

## Adding Users to the Admin Console User Groups {#adding-users-to-the-admin-console-user-groups}

After you've created User Groups, the next step is to grant access to the Bizible application by adding users.

|User Group|Description|
|---|---|
|BizibleAdmins|these are administrators and power users of the Bizible Application with full ability to update and manage Bizible-specific configuration options|
|BizibleUsers|these are standard users of the Bizible Application with read only permissions within the Bizible application|

When adding a user to their respective group, you'll see their [Identity Type listed](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/set-up-identity.ug.html).

After a user has been added to a group, they're able to access the Bizible instance by choosing the Sign in with Adobe ID option at https://apps.bizible.com.
